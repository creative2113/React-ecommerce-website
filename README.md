# A React E-Commerce Application

## About the project -

- This is a mock e-commerce website built using React, with the main functionality being the shopping cart. This project implements different React hooks such as useState(), useEffect(), useContext() and a custom hook, as well as context API and React routing. The app uses fake data from the FakerJS/Faker API and is deployed on Firebase hosting.

- Each page has a top navigation bar with the app logo, which redirects the user to the home page upon clicking. It also includes a working search bar, which renders all the matching products on typing the search query, both on the home page and the cart page. A cart button shows the count of products added to the cart and a dropdown with all those products.

- There is a lower navigation bar which has a home button that also redirects the user to the home page, and a dark mode button that allows users to toggle between light mode and dark mode.

- The home page of this app contains a variety of fake e-commerce product data with an "add to cart" button and a "remove from cart" button. Additionally, the home page features a left sidebar with all the filters, including:
i) Ascending - re-renders product data in ascending order.
ii) Descending - re-renders product data in descending order.
iii) Include out of stock items.
iv) Fast delivery only.
v) Rating.
There is also a "clear filters" button that clears all the currently applied filters.

- The user can add or delete as many products as they want to/from the cart and view the cart.

- The user can view the cart page with all the products added to the cart, and the subtotal is displayed, along with a fake checkout button. Users can also delete items from the checkout page or increase the number of items.

- This app has a total of 2 pages: the home page and the cart page.

- This application is fully responsive.
